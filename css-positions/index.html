position: fixed positions an element relative to the viewport and keeps it fixed in that position even during scrolling.
position: sticky positions an element relative to its containing element and remains in the normal flow until a certain scroll threshold is reached, at which point it becomes "sticky" and scrolls with the document until it reaches another threshold where it "unsticks." -->
